### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![Logo](stonecharioteer.png)

I'm Vinay Keerthi, and I go by @stonecharioteer everywhere. I blog at
[tech.stonecharioteer.com](https://tech.stonecharioteer.com), about technology, life as a
programmer and, sometimes, traveling and books.

I am active in the Python meetup space in Bangalore and India, and I've been
mentoring graduates and junior developers. I have previously worked at ChainSafe, Merkle Science and Visa Inc. My preferred programming languages are Python and Rust. 

I'm an avid Linux user since 2006 and believe that $YEAR is the year of the Linux Desktop!

I've also dabbled in MicroPython and UI Development. I enjoy talking about
development practices, and technology in general.
