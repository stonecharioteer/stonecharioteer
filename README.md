### Hi there 👋

I'm Vinay Keerthi, and I go by @stonecharioteer everywhere. I blog at
[stonecharioteer.com](https://stonecharioteer.com), about technology, life as a
programmer and, sometimes, traveling and books.

I am active in the Python meetup space in Bangalore and India, and I've been
mentoring graduates and junior developers. I currently work at Merkle Science as
an Architect/Lead Software Developer. I code in Python and Rust, and I am an
avid Linux user.

I've also dabbled in MicroPython and UI Development. I enjoy talking about
development practices, and technology in general.
